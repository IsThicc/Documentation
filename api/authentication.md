# Authentication 

Not all endpoints require authentication. To view which require authentication visit [this](https://docs.isthicc.dev/api/basics) documentation article!

In order to authenticate against the API you will need an API token. To get a token you will need a dashboard account [here](https://isthicc.dev/login)! After you create an account you can create a token [here](https://isthicc.dev/dash/api). In order to use your token, verify the endpoint you are trying to use requires authentication, after you've done that, supply your API token in the "Authentication" header.
