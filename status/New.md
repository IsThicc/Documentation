# Setting up ThiccStatus

IsThicc Software works on a "Service" based system. In the sense of ThiccStatus, this means for 
every HTTP(s) URL, TCP Port, UDP Port, Discord.py Client, or Minecraft Server, you will need to 
make a new Service. You can view all your services, and create more on our Dashboard. Detailed 
instructions on how to create a new Service is on the next page.
